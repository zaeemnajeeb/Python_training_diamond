'''
Synchronizing Processes
=======================
When you are running code concurrently in multiple processes, you often need to synchronise code using locks.  In
this example the "print()" function's output gets garbled unless you synchronize output with:
            synchronize = True
to enable the locking to operate.

import multiprocessing as mp
import time, os


def fn(lock): #ensure only 1 process runs code at 1 time - forces serialisation
    for n in range(50):
        if synchronize: lock.acquire()
        print(f"This is ", end="")
        print(f"process ", end="")
        print(f"{os.getpid()}")
        if synchronize: lock.release()
        time.sleep(0.005)

if __name__ == '__main__': 
    ''' output will be garbled unless synchronize = True '''
    synchronize = False

    processes = []
    lock = mp.Lock()
    for n in range(10):
        p = mp.Process(target=fn, args=(lock,))
        processes.append(p)
        p.start()
    for p in processes:
        p.join()
